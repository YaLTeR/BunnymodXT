// cmd.h -- Command buffer and command execution

//===========================================================================

/*
Any number of commands can be added in a frame, from several different sources.
Most commands come from either keybindings or console line input, but remote
servers can also send across commands and entire text files can be execed.
The + command line options are also added to the command buffer.
The game starts with a Cbuf_AddText ("exec quake.rc\n"); Cbuf_Execute ();
*/

//===========================================================================

/*
Command execution takes a null terminated string, breaks it into tokens,
then searches for a command or variable that matches the first token.
Commands can come from three sources, but the handler functions may choose
to dissallow the action or forward it to a remote server if the source is
not apropriate.
