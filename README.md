# Bunnymod XT

### VAC BAN WARNING: Do NOT connect to servers with this injected, or you might get VAC banned!

Bunnymod XT (BXT for short) is a cross-platform tool that provides speedrunning and TAS-related features for GoldSource games such as Half-Life and its modifications.

Used by hundreds if not thousands of speedrunners worldwide.

Bunnymod XT provides state-of-the-art speedrunning and TASing features and utilities, ranging from detailed HUDs to advanced autostrafing. It is a successor to the obsoleted hlspbunny and Bunnymod Pro.

## Why?

Despite the "mod" in Bunnymod XT, this is not a mod in the usual sense. Most Half-Life modifications work by modifying the Half-Life SDK and distributing the resulting DLLs. This includes the deprecated Bunnymod Pro. The downside is that while you can "mod" Half-Life itself, you cannot "mod" another Half-Life mod. This is a serious limitation for speedrunners intending to speedrun Half-Life mods and expansions.

To rectify this, Bunnymod XT injects into the Half-Life process while leaving every file on the disk intact. This means all modifications are done on-the-fly in RAM. This also means Bunnymod XT supports a wider range of Half-Life engines, from WON to the latest Steam.

## Installation

### Windows

The instructions are described [here](https://github.com/YaLTeR/BunnymodXT/wiki).

### Linux

Use the [Bunnymod XT Launcher](https://github.com/YaLTeR/bxt-launcher).

## Documentation

[On the Wiki pages](https://github.com/YaLTeR/BunnymodXT/wiki).

### Environment variables

- **BXT_SCRIPT** - if set to a filename of a hltas script, loads the non-shared RNG from that script on load.
- **BXT_LOGFILE** - if set, logs all Bunnymod XT messages into a file with that filename.
- **SPTLIB_DEBUG** - if set to 1, logs all dlopen, dlclose and dlsym calls.
- **BXT_DISABLE_DEBUG_CONSOLE** - if set, disables the Bunnymod XT debug console.
- **BXT_DISABLE_DISCORD_RPC** - if set, disables the Discord RPC module.
- **BXT_DISABLE_VSYNC** - if set, disables the V-Sync on initialization (Windows-only).

## Building

### Windows

Building on Windows requires

- Visual Studio 2019 or 2022
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
  - The `i686-pc-windows-msvc` target must be installed. You can do that using `rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc`.

Run the following commands, replacing `path\to\boost\base\dir` with path to the Boost base directory:

    git clone https://github.com/YaLTeR/BunnymodXT
    cd BunnymodXT
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -A Win32 -DBOOST_ROOT=path\to\boost\base\dir -Wno-dev ..

Then compile the `ALL_BUILD` project from the generated VS solution.

If you want to make a release build, you need to specify `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` in the `cmake` command line arguments. This is needed because the Rust CMake module uses that variable to determine whether to build the crate in release or debug mode.

### Linux

#### GNOME Builder
1. Set up Flathub by following the [guide](https://flatpak.org/setup/) for your distribution.
1. Install [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder).
1. Open GNOME Builder.
1. Press the Clone Repository button, enter `https://github.com/YaLTeR/BunnymodXT.git` and press Clone Project. Wait until it finishes.

   The cloning window should close, and a new window with the BunnymodXT project should open.
1. If Builder prompts you to install missing SDKs, press Install and wait for the process to finish. It will take a while. You can monitor the progress by pressing the circle in the top-right.
1. Click on the bar at the top-center which says BunnymodXT, and click the Build button.
1. Once the build finishes, in the same bar menu click the Export Bundle button. The file manager will open in a path that looks like `gnome-builder/projects/BunnymodXT/flatpak/staging/x86_64-master`. Navigate up to the `BunnymodXT` folder, then down to `builds/rs.bxt.BunnymodXT.json-...` where you will find the built `libBunnymodXT.so`.
1. Now you can make some changes to the code and press Build, then grab `libBunnymodXT.so` from the same folder.

#### Manually

Building on Linux requires

- A recent GCC or Clang toolchain
- Boost
- Rust: either from your distribution's packages, or from [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
  - The `i686-unknown-linux-gnu` target must be installed. You can do that using `rustup target add i686-unknown-linux-gnu`.

Many of these dependencies can be installed from a package manager.

    git clone https://github.com/YaLTeR/BunnymodXT
    cd BunnymodXT
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -Wno-dev ..
    make

Note that `-DBOOST_ROOT` is not required as CMake should be able to find its location in your system. In case it couldn't, you need to specify it manually like the case on Windows.
